# ============================================================
# Migration: Normalize existing users' emails to canonical form
# File: migrate_normalize_emails.py
#
# Why this is needed: canonicalize_email() (in models/email_utils.py)
# strips Gmail's dots and "+tag" tricks going forward. But any account
# that registered BEFORE this fix may have its email stored exactly as
# typed — e.g. "Anmol.Pandey@gmail.com" instead of "anmolpandey@gmail.com".
# Without this migration, that user's login would stop matching once
# login also canonicalizes the entered email.
#
# Safety: if two existing rows would canonicalize to the SAME email
# (meaning the same person genuinely already has two separate accounts
# today), this script does NOT silently merge or delete anything — it
# skips that group and prints it for you to resolve by hand, then
# normalizes everything else.
#
# Uses SQLAlchemy (via models.database), so it works against whatever
# DATABASE_URL is configured — Postgres (Neon) in production, or local
# SQLite in dev — unlike the older migrate_*.py scripts in this repo
# which hardcode sqlite3.
#
# Run once, from intervyx-backend/:
#   python migrate_normalize_emails.py
