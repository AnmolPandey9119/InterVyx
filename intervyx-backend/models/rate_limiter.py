# ============================================================
# Rate Limiter
# File: models/rate_limiter.py
#
# A minimal in-memory sliding-window limiter for brute-force protection
# on sensitive endpoints (login, admin login). No new dependency, no
# Redis — fine for a single web-service instance (which is what this
# app runs on Render). If this service is ever scaled to multiple
# instances behind a load balancer, this in-memory store stops being
# shared across them and a Redis-backed limiter would be needed instead.
#
# Usage pattern (see routes/auth.py and routes/admin.py):
#   1. is_limited(key, max_attempts, window_seconds) BEFORE checking
#      credentials — blocks the request early, without even touching
#      bcrypt, if the caller is already over the limit.
#   2. On a FAILED login, record_failure(key) — only failures count
#      against the limit, so a normal user who mistypes their password
#      once or twice and then gets it right is never penalized.
#   3. On a SUCCESSFUL login, clear(key) — wipes the slate for that key.
