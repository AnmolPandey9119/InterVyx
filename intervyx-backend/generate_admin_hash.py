# ============================================================
# Run this LOCALLY (never on a public server) to generate the
# value you'll paste into Render's ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH env var.
#
# Usage:
#   cd intervyx-backend
#   python generate_admin_hash.py
#
# Note: the password is typed visibly (not hidden) — some
# terminals (including VS Code's integrated terminal on Windows)
# don't handle hidden input reliably. This only runs locally and
# only the resulting hash goes anywhere, so it's fine.
